# Home Lab Setup for Cybersecurity Testing

Objective:


The goal of this project was to create a secure virtual lab environment to practice and test various
cybersecurity tools and techniques. The lab simulates real-world network conditions to allow for hands-on
experience in ethical hacking, network monitoring, and incident response.


Tools Used:

● VirtualBox

● Kali Linux

● Metasploitable 2

● Windows Server 2016

Methodology:
1. Configured VirtualBox to host multiple virtual machines in a segmented network environment.
2. Installed and configured Kali Linux as the primary offensive security testing machine.
3. Set up Metasploitable 2 as a vulnerable target machine to practice exploitation.
4. Created an isolated network to ensure secure testing without impacting external systems.


Challenges Faced & Solutions:
● Challenge: Network performance issues due to resource limitations.

● Solution: Optimized VM resource allocation and adjusted VirtualBox settings to improve
efficiency.

Outcome:
Successfully established a secure and functional lab environment. This setup allowed for the safe practice of
cybersecurity techniques and improved my understanding of network architecture and isolation principles.
