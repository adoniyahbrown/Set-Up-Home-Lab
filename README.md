# Set Up A Home Lab

## Objective

Setting up a home lab is a fundamental step for anyone interested in practicing and improving their cybersecurity skills. This detailed guide will help you create a virtual network with multiple machines, allowing you to stimulate attacks and defenses in a controlled environment.

### Skills Learned
- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.
  
### Tools Used

- Wireshark: Network protocol analyzer for capturing and analyzing network traffic.
- Nmap: Network scanning tool for discovering hosts and services on a network.
- Metasploit: Exploitation framework for penetration testing.
- Netcat: Utility for reading from and writing to network connections.
- Burp Suite: Web vulnerability scanner and penetration testing toolkit.
